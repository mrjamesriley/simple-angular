# Simple Angular Demonstration

An Angular demonstration built around the [HTTP Tutorial](http://tutorials.codebar.io/js/lesson4/tutorial.html) at Codebar. Not an example of best practice, simply a working set of various Angular components.

A more complete example, my [Learning Mangager](https://github.com/mrjamesriley/learning-manager) is occasionally updated.
